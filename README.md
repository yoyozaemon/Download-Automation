# Download-Automation

Automating the process of sorting files in a user's downloads folder on Windows by file type.

This script iterates through the files in the downloads folder and moves them to their respective sub-folders. If the 
sub-folder does not exist, it is created then the files moved into it.

## Usage
From a terminal, navigate into the project directory.
```
$ cd downloads-folder-automation
```
To run the script:
```
$ python downloads_folder_sorter.py
```
